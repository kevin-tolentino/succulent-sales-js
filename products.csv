1,Aeonium Greenstar,599,/images/aeonium-greenstar.jpg," A feature which distinguishes this genus from many of its relatives is the manner in which the flowers bear free petals, and are divided into 6 or 12 sections.","Aeonium, the tree houseleeks, is a genus of about 35 species of succulent, subtropical plants of the family Crassulaceae. Many species are popular in horticulture. The genus name comes from the ancient Greek ""aionos"" (ageless). While most of them are native to the Canary Islands, some are found in Madeira, Morocco, and in East Africa (for example in the Semien Mountains of Ethiopia). The succulent leaves are typically arranged on a basal stem, in a dense, spreading rosette. A feature which distinguishes this genus from many of its relatives is the manner in which the flowers bear free petals, and are divided into 6 or 12 sections. Each rosette produces a central inflorescence only once, and then dies back (though it will usually branch or offset to produce ensuing rosettes)."
2,Aloe Brevifolia,799,/images/aloe-brevifolia.jpg,"As it requires winter heat, in temperate regions it is grown under glass or as a houseplant.","Aloe brevifolia, the short-leaved aloe, is a species of flowering plant in the family Asphodelaceae. It is a tiny, compact, blue-green evergreen succulent perennial, that is native to the Western Cape, South Africa. Listed as Vulnerable on IUCN's global Red List, it is threatened in its natural habitat, but is also widely popular as an ornamental plant in rockeries and desert gardens worldwide. As it requires winter heat, in temperate regions it is grown under glass or as a houseplant. In the wild, this diminutive species is completely confined to the dry clay soil of “Rûens Shale Renosterveld” – a critically endangered and rapidly disappearing vegetation type. Small populations are normally found growing on inaccessible rocky slopes and cliffs, especially near the coast, but it is thought that these are merely relics of what was once a much wider distribution. There are several subspecies, which are now separated from each other by farmland and other development."
3,Aloe Ciliaris,699,/images/aloe-ciliaris.jpg,The fleshy leaves themselves are strongly recurved (helping to anchor the tall stems in dense thickets and assist the plant in climbing).,"They can be differentiated from other Aloiampelos species by the way that the soft, white, hair-like teeth that grow along the margins of the leaves, extend all the way around the stem, at the base of the leaf. The fleshy leaves themselves are strongly recurved (helping to anchor the tall stems in dense thickets and assist the plant in climbing). The leaf sheaths are conspicuously striped green and white. These plants grow very quickly, producing long, thin, untidy stems that shoot upwards, producing large bright orange-red flowers once they reach the sun. If there are no nearby trees to act as host and support, it just forms a straggly shrub. The red flowers appear mostly from November to April."
4,Cleistocactus Strausi,599,/images/cleistocactus-strausi.jpg,"It is native to mountainous regions of Department Tarija, Bolivia between 1,500 m (4,921 ft) and 3,000 m (9,843 ft).","Cleistocactus strausii, the silver torch or wooly torch, is a perennial cactus of the family Cactaceae. It is native to mountainous regions of Department Tarija, Bolivia between 1,500 m (4,921 ft) and 3,000 m (9,843 ft). Its slender, erect, grey-green columns can reach a height of 3 m (9.8 ft), but are only about 6 cm (2.5 in) across. The columns are formed from around 25 ribs and are densely covered with areoles, supporting four yellow-brown spines up to 4 cm (1.5 in) long and 20 shorter white radials. The cactus prefers free draining soils, strong sunlight, but not high temperatures — in fact it can withstand hard frosts down to -10 °C. In its natural habitat it receives plenty of water during the summer, but almost none over the winter. "
5,Crassula Arborescens Silver Dollar,999,/images/crassula-arborescens-silver-dollar.jpg,"It has round gray ""Silver Dollar"" leaves. It blooms in winter, with white to pink flowers.","Crassula arborescens, the silver jade plant, silver dollar plant, beestebul, Chinese jade, money plant, or money tree, is a species of succulent plant in the family Crassulaceae. It is an endemic plant of the Western Cape, South Africa. It is a 2 to 4 ft (0.6 to 1.2 m) succulent shrub. It has round gray ""Silver Dollar"" leaves. It blooms in winter, with white to pink flowers. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant for use in drought tolerant and succulent gardens, and in container gardens. It is also suitable for growing indoors as a houseplant."
6,First Lady Echeveria,830,/images/tater-mitts.jpg,It is drought tolerant and deer resistant and attracts hummingbirds when it flowers.,"First Lady Echeveria is a very decorative succulent perennial for the rock garden or containers, growing as blue green rosettes with frilly pink edges. It is drought tolerant and deer resistant and attracts hummingbirds when it flowers. The color may very due to light or cooler temperatures. Not frost tolerant. Plants may be evergreen or deciduous. Flowers on short stalks (cymes) arise from compact rosettes of succulent fleshy, often brightly coloured leaves.[2] Species are polycarpic, meaning that they may flower and set seed many times over the course of their lifetimes."
,Haworthia Turgida,799,/images/haworthia-turgida.jpg,The main type has pale green leaves but varies widely,"Haworthia turgida, also sometimes known as the windowpane plant, is a species of Haworthia native to the Cape Provinces. Its common name comes from the translucent panes on its leaves, which are similar to those of Haworthia cooperi and some other species in the genus. It grows in dense clusters of offsets from the base, and in its native habitat prefers rocky limestone or slate cliffs. The main type has pale green leaves but varies widely. Varieties include Haworthia turgida var. longibracteata (M.B.Bayer) and Haworthia turgida var. suberecta (Poelln.)."
6,Peperomia Dolabriformis Maxi,830,/images/peperomia-maxi.jpg,"Most of them are compact, small perennial epiphytes growing on rotten wood. More than 1500 species have been recorded.","Peperomia (radiator plant) is one of the two large genera of the family Piperaceae, with more than 1000 recorded species. Most of them are compact, small perennial epiphytes growing on rotten wood. More than 1500 species have been recorded, occurring in all tropical and subtropical regions of the world, though concentrated in Central America and northern South America. A limited number of species (around 17) are found in Africa. These tropical perennials are grown for their ornamental foliage. They are mostly natives of tropical America. They are compact and usually do not exceed 12 inches (30 cm) in height. They vary considerably in appearance. Some have threadlike, trailing stems and some have fleshy, stout stems."
